## Our manifesto

-   **You own your time**
    -   A recruitment process should not take more than two weeks of YOUR time.
    -   You should be contacted in the way YOU want to, ”a quick phone call” isn’t the best way of sharing
        information. And usually not as quick as one could think.
-   **You own your integrity**
    -   You should only be contacted if you want to, and with relevant roles.
    -   You should feel chosen when contacted by a recruiter, not one of many in a mass delivery of CVs.
-   **You own your CV**
    -   No one, besides yourself, should profit from simply sharing your CV with potential employers.

This is the manifesto we live by, we want to make our clients the happiest coders in the world. And we
think the way to achieve this is through a long standing relationship.
