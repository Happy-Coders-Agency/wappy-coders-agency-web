Tired of the line above? Heard it one too many times
from recruiters that don’t give a rats ass about who
you are and what your **career goals** are?

We are not a recruitment company, we are
an **agency for developers**. We don’t aim to make some
quick money pushing your CV to a company in need of
anyone that have even heard of Java (or whatever
technology).

We build relationships with both companies in need
of recruitment, and more importantly, with great
developers that want the best out of their career.
Whether it is a **high salary**, working for a **“hot”
company**, **flexible working locations/hours** or
something completely different. Whatever makes **YOU HAPPY**!
You, our clients,
decide what’s **important in your life**, and we try our
very best to match you with a company that realizes your
value and are willing to meet your every demand. And when
you found that company, we help you grow there.
