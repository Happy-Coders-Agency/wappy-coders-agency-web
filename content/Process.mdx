## Our process

So enough of buzzwords and sales material, what’s in
it for you? Our process looks like this:

-   A first meeting (remotely works fine) where we get to know each other.
-   You then decide if you want to use our services.
-   If you do, it actually will cost you 49 SEK each month, as long as you decide to be a client.
-   We meet again and get to know your needs, your current status etc.
-   Now our process to find what you are looking for starts, you decide if you want us to screen
    the offers and just show you the ones tat are an exact match of your needs, or if you want us to spam you
    with every job offer we ever get. Although, we aren’t your best option if you want to fill
    up your inbox with offers.
-   Next step is coaching, it could be anything from looking at your CV or application, doing mock
    interviews or just be a good adviser when it comes to your career.
-   Hopefully you get the position you were looking for, and as a bonus we pay you 10 000 SEK, so as
    long as you don’t wait 200 months our service has, at worst, been free.
-   We invoice the company that hires you (way more money), and they should feel that they’ve gotten value for
    their money.
-   But you don’t get rid of us here (like ordinary recruiters), we keep in contact to see that
    everything is what you expected. We can help you plan your career even when you’re not actively
    looking for a new job. We can coach you when you need to negotiate for a better salary etc. We
    also want to get to know you even better, so we can do an even better job, finding the next step
    in your career.
-   But it this is entirely up to you, we won’t contact you more than you want us to, you decide, you own your time.
