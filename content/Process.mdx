## Our process

So enough of buzzwords and sales material, what’s in
it for you? Our process looks like this:

-   A first meeting (remotely works fine) where we get to know each other.
-   You then decide if you want to use our services.
-   If you do, it actually will cost you 49 SEK each month, as long as you decide to be a client.
-   We meet again and get to know your needs, your current status etc.
-   Now our process starts, and there are two modes for that:
    -   **Active:** We start looking for a position that matches your desires, you decide if you want us to
        screen the offers and just show you the ones that are an exact match, or if you want us to spam you
        with every job offer we ever get. Although, we aren’t your best option if you want to fill up your
        inbox with general offers.
    -   **Passive:** You stay at your current position and use us for coaching and other services to support
        your career (Auditing your CV, doing mock interviews etc). We also have an eye open for that perfect
        position that you might be dreaming of, but we still only contact you with an offer if you really want
        us to.
-   Someday we might get you the position you were looking for, and as a bonus we pay you 10 000 SEK, so as
    long as you don’t wait 200 months our service has, at worst, been for free.
-   We invoice the company that hires you (way more money), and they will definitely feel that they’ve gotten
    value for their money.
-   But you don’t get rid of us here (you just enter passive mode), we keep in contact to see that everything is what you expected. We can help
    you plan your career even when you’re not actively looking for a new job. We can coach you when you need to
    negotiate for a better salary etc. We also want to get to know you even better, so we can do an even better job,
    finding the next step in your career.
-   But it this is entirely up to you, we won’t contact you more than you want us to, you decide, you own your time.
