                            We are collaborating with a large number of
                            companies, but with some companies we have a very
                            close relationship, partners. Partners benefit from
                            our agency in a much deeper fashion. With partners
                            we try to capture the soul of the company, so we
                            will be able to quickly tell if a certain client
                            would be a good fit at that company. This result in
                            partner companies can spend much less time screening
                            candidates, as this has already been done by us.
