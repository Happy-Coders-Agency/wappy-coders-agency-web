                            We try to build long time partnership, not only with
                            our clients, but with companies that have clients
                            working there or looking to recruit developers. With
                            our company partners we try to capture the soul of
                            the company, firstly to be able to move much quicker
                            in a recruitment process (The goal is to eliminate
                            the need of screening and initial interviews).
                            Secondly to further inform us what companies can do
                            to make coders happy.
